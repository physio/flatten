# flatten-ts

**flatten-ts** is a lightweight TypeScript library for flattening arrays of any depth into a single-level array.

Using the flatten method has several advantages, including:
Usage
1 - Reduced code complexity: **flatten** simplifies the process of manipulating arrays of arrays, reducing the need for writing complex code to perform this operation.

2 - Improved code readability: Using **flatten** makes the code more readable, as it is easier to understand what the code is doing when using a standard method instead of writing custom code.

3 - Performance improvements: **flatten** is a native method of JavaScript, which means it has been optimized for performance. This means that using flatten can improve the performance of the code compared to using custom methods for manipulating arrays of arrays.

4 - Cross-browser support: **flatten** is a native method of JavaScript, which means it is supported by all modern browsers. This means that it can be reliably used in all JavaScript projects, regardless of the browser used by users.

Overall, using flatten in JavaScript can simplify the manipulation of arrays of arrays, improve the performance of the code, and make the code more readable and maintainable.

## Installation
